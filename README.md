# Tutorials-for-Neural-Circuit-Organization

The Hoffman Lab is developing tutorials and demos to guide researchers through the steps from neural ensemble data collection, to preprocessing, to ensemble analysis. Please see our initial efforts to guide you in:

[High-Density Spike sorting](https://github.com/hoffman-lab/SpikeSortingLauncher)

[Cell Class Class](https://github.com/hoffman-lab/CellGroupClassification) 

[Ensemble Representational Space, or, Demystifying Manifolds](https://github.com/hoffman-lab/Ensemble-Representational-Space)
